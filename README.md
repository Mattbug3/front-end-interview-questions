# Interview Questions

###### 1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript:

1. Primitive data type.
- String.
- Number.
- Bigint.
- Boolean.
- Undefined.
- Null.
- Symbol.

2. Non-primitive (reference) data type.
- Array.
- Object.

###### 2. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
  
In JavaScript, we can declare a variable using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. Here's how we can use each of them:
  
#### 1. Using `var`:
  
```javascript
var variableName;
```
Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope, but not block scope. They can be re-declared and updated within their scope.

#### 2. Using `let`:

```javascript
let variableName;
```
Variables declared with `let` have block scope. They can be updated within their scope but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

#### 2. Using `const`:
```javascript
const variableName = value;
```
Variables declared with `const` are constants and cannot be reassigned after initialization. They have block scope like variables declared with `let`.

Here are some examples:

```javascript
// Using var
var age;

// Using let
let name;

// Using const
const PI = 3.14;
```
When we declare a variable using `let` or `const`, it's a good practice to initialize it with a value, although it's not mandatory.

###### 3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

  The main differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript lie in their **scoping rules** , **reassignment**, **and ability to be redeclared**. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

#### 1. Scoping:

- `var`: Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope. They are function-scoped if declared inside a function, or globally scoped if declared outside any function.
- `let` and `const`: Variables declared with `let` and `const` have block scope. They are scoped to the nearest enclosing block, which can be a function, loop, or any other block statement.

```javascript
function exampleScope() {
    if (true) {
        var varVariable = 'I am var';
        let letVariable = 'I am let';
        const constVariable = 'I am const';
    }
    console.log(varVariable); // Works
    console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
    console.log(constVariable); // ReferenceError: constVariable is not defined
}

exampleScope();
```
In this example, `varVariable` is accessible outside the block because it's declared with `var`, which has **function scope**. `letVariable` and `constVariable` are not accessible outside the block because they are declared with `let` and `const`, respectively, which have **block scope**.

#### 2. Reassignment:

- `var`: Variables declared with `var` **can be updated** and **reassigned** within their scope.
- `let`: Variables declared with let **can be updated** and **reassigned** within their scope, just like var.
- `const`: Variables declared with const **cannot be reassigned** after initialization. However, **if the variable holds a reference to an object, the properties of that object can be modified**.

```javascript
var varValue = 10;
let letValue = 20;
const constValue = 30;

varValue = 11; // Works
letValue = 21; // Works
constValue = 31; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```
In this example, we can see that `varValue` and `letValue` can be reassigned new values without any error. However, attempting to reassign a new value to `constValue` results in an error because it's declared with const, which **doesn't allow reassignment**.

#### 3. Redeclaration:

- `var`: Variables declared with `var` **can be redeclared** within the same scope without any error.
- `let`: Variables declared with `let` **cannot be redeclared** in the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a **syntax error**.
- `const`: Like `let`, variables declared with `const` **cannot be redeclared** in the same scope. Attempting to do so will also result in a **syntax error**.

```javascript
var varVariable = 'I am var';
let letVariable = 'I am let';
const constVariable = 'I am const';

var varVariable = 'I am redeclared var'; // Works
let letVariable = 'I am redeclared let'; // Error: Identifier 'letVariable' has already been declared
const constVariable = 'I am redeclared const'; // Error: Identifier 'constVariable' has already been declared
```

In this example, we can see that we can redeclare `varVariable` with `var`, but attempting to redeclare `letVariable` or `constVariable` with `let` or `const`, respectively, results in errors because they have already been declared in the same scope.

#### Here's a summary:

- Use `var` for variables that need to have *function* or *global scope* and might *need to be redeclared*.
- Use `let` for variables that have *block scope* and might *need to be reassigned, but not redeclared*.
- Use `const` for variables that have *block scope* and *whose value should not change after initialization*.

###### 4.  How does hoisting work in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within their scope, they are treated as if they were declared at the top of the scope.

Here's how hoisting works for variables and functions:

#### 1. Variable Hoisting:

- When variables are declared with `var`, they are hoisted to the top of their containing function scope or global scope.
However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. This means that variables are initialized with `undefined` by default until their actual assignment is reached in the code.
- Variables declared with `let` or `const` are also hoisted to the top of their containing block scope, but they are not initialized until their actual declaration is reached in the code. This is called the `temporal dead zone` and attempting to access these variables before their declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

Here's an example to illustrate variable hoisting:

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
// This is equivalent to:

var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 5;

console.log(z); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
let z = 10;
```

#### 2. Function Hoisting:

- Function declarations are completely hoisted, including both the declaration and the function definition.
This means that we can call a function before it's declared in the code, and it will still work.

Here's an example to illustrate function hoisting:

```javascript
foo(); // "Hello, I am foo!"

function foo() {
    console.log("Hello, I am foo!");
}

// This is equivalent to:

function foo() {
    console.log("Hello, I am foo!");
}

foo(); // "Hello, I am foo!"
```

It's important to understand hoisting in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior and to write more readable and maintainable code.

###### 5. What are closures in JavaScript and how are they work?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### 1. Definition: 

When an inner function is defined within an outer function, the inner function retains a reference to the variables in the outer function's scope, even after the outer function has completed execution. This combination of the inner function and the variables it has access to forms a `closure`.

#### 2. How closures work:

- ##### Access to Outer Scope Variables: 
The inner function can access the variables, parameters, and functions of the outer function, as well as the global scope. This is possible because the inner function retains a reference to the variables in its lexical scope.

- ##### Preservation of Scope: 
`Closures` allow functions to maintain references to variables from their containing scopes, preventing those variables from being garbage-collected when the outer function finishes executing. This enables powerful patterns such as data encapsulation and private variables.

Here's an example to illustrate closures:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am outer';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses outerVariable from the outer function's scope
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Outputs: "I am outer"
```
In this example, `innerFunction` is defined within `outerFunction` and has access to `outerVariable`. Even after `outerFunction` has finished executing, the `closure` function (which is `innerFunction`) still has access to `outerVariable`, thanks to the `closure`. This allows `closure` to access and use `outerVariable` when it's invoked.
</details>

###### 6. How do you use callbacks in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, a callback is a function that we pass as an argument to another function and execute after the completion of a particular task or event. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous operations, such as handling events, making API requests, or dealing with timeouts.

For instance, let's say we want to fetch data from a server using an asynchronous HTTP request. We can define a callback function to handle the response data once it's available:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => callback(data))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
}

function processResponse(data) {
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData('https://api.example.com/data', processResponse);
```

In this example, `fetchData` is a function that makes an asynchronous HTTP request to the specified URL. We pass a callback function (`processResponse`) as an argument. Once the data is fetched successfully, the `callback` function is invoked with the response data. This allows us to handle the response data in the `processResponse` function, which could involve rendering it on the UI or performing additional processing.

Another example involves handling events in a web application. Suppose we want to add a click event listener to a button element and execute a callback function when the button is clicked:

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked');
}

button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```
In this case, the `handleClick` function is passed as a `callback`to the `addEventListener` method. When the `button` is `clicked`, the `handleClick` function is executed, logging `Button clicked` to the console.

Here's another example showcasing the usage of callbacks for dealing with timeouts:

```javascript
function delayedMessage(message, delay, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(message);
        callback();
    }, delay);
}

function afterDelay() {
    console.log('Callback executed after delay');
}

// Call delayedMessage function with a message, delay of 2 seconds, and a callback
delayedMessage('This message is delayed by 2 seconds', 2000, afterDelay);
```
In this example, we define a function called `delayedMessage` that takes three parameters: `message` (the message to be logged), `delay` (the delay time in milliseconds), and `callback` (the callback function to be executed after the delay). Inside `delayedMessage`, we use `setTimeout` to schedule the execution of a function after the specified delay. Once the delay is over, the provided `message` is logged to the console, and then the `callback` function is invoked.

We also define a `callback` function called `afterDelay`, which simply logs a `message` indicating that it has been executed. Finally, we call the `delayedMessage` function with the `message` to be displayed after the `delay`, a `delay` of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds), and the `afterDelay` function as the `callback`. This demonstrates how we can use `callbacks` to perform actions after a specified delay, such as `animations`, `notifications`, or other `asynchronous` tasks.

###### 7. What are promises in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
In JavaScript, promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. We use them to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or executing animations, where the result may not be available immediately.

We can create a promise using the `Promise` constructor, passing a function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters. Inside this function, we perform an asynchronous operation, like using `setTimeout` to simulate a delay, and then resolve or reject the promise based on the result.

```javascript
// Creating a promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
        const randomNumber = Math.random();
        if (randomNumber > 0.5) {
            resolve(randomNumber); // Resolve the promise with a value
        } else {
            reject(new Error('Random number is too small')); // Reject the promise with an error
        }
    }, 1000);
});

// Handling the promise
myPromise.then((result) => {
    console.log('Promise fulfilled with result:', result);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log('Promise rejected with error:', error.message);
});
```
Here, we handle the `fulfilled` state (success) of the promise using the `then()` method and the `rejected` state (failure) using the `catch()` method. Promises provide a cleaner and more flexible way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches, allowing for better error handling and chaining of multiple asynchronous operations.
</details>

###### 8. What is async/await in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, `async/await` is a syntax used to work with asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner. It provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

The `async` keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function returns a promise implicitly, allowing us to use `await` within it to pause the execution of the function until a promise is settled (resolved or rejected).

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
}

fetchData();
```

In this example:

- We define an asynchronous function `fetchData()` using the `async` keyword.
Inside the function, we use `await` to pause the execution of the function until the fetch operation completes and resolves the promise returned by `fetch()`.
- We then use `await` again to pause the execution until the `response.json()` operation completes and resolves the promise.
- If any error occurs during the execution of the asynchronous operations, it is caught and handled using a `try...catch` block.

`async/await` simplifies the process of working with promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write compared to using raw promises or callback-based approaches.
</details>

###### 9. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, we handle errors using` try...catch` blocks and error objects. Here's how we do it:

```javascript
try {
    // Code that might throw an error
    throw new Error('An error occurred');
} catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```
In this example:

- We wrap the code that might throw an error inside a try block.
- If an error occurs within the try block, it's caught by the catch block.
- The error object contains information about the error, such as its message, name, and stack trace.
- We can then handle the error appropriately, such as logging it or displaying a message to the user.

Additionally, we can also use the `finally` block to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred or not:

```javascript
try {
    // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
} finally {
    // Code to execute regardless of errors
}
```
This allows us to clean up resources or perform cleanup tasks that need to be done regardless of the outcome of the `try...catch` block.

###### 10. How do you create and manipulate objects in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, we create and manipulate objects using `object literals`, `constructor functions`, and `classes`. Here's how we do it:

#### 1. Object Literals:

```javascript
// Creating an object using object literal
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
};

// Accessing properties and methods
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
#### 2. Constructor Functions:

```javascript
// Defining a constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    // Adding a method to the prototype
    this.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};
}


// Creating objects using the constructor function
const person1 = new Person('John', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Alice', 25);

// Accessing properties and methods
console.log(person1.name); // Output: John
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.

```

#### 3. Classes (ES6+):

```javascript
// Defining a class
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}

// Creating objects using the class
const person1 = new Person('John', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Alice', 25);

// Accessing properties and methods
console.log(person1.name); // Output: John
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
These are the common ways to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript. Depending on the scenario and personal preference, we can choose the approach that best suits our needs.

###### 11. What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are comparison operators used to compare values. However, they have different behaviors:

1. `==` (loose equality operator): It checks for equality of values after converting the operands to the same type. If the operands are of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert them to a common type before making the comparison. For example:
  - `0 == '0'` evaluates to `true` because JavaScript converts the string '0' to a number before making the comparison.
  - `1 == true` evaluates to `true` because JavaScript treats true as 1 when making the comparison.

2. `===` (strict equality operator): It checks for equality of values without performing any type conversion. Both the value and the type of the operands must be the same for the comparison to return true. For example:
  - `0 === '0'` evaluates to `false` because the types of the operands are different.
  - `1 === true` evaluates to `false` because the types of the operands are different.

In general, it's considered a best practice to use `===` for comparisons in JavaScript because it avoids unexpected type conversions and leads to more predictable code behavior.
</details>

###### 12. What are the different types of operators in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
In JavaScript, operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands. They can be classified into several categories based on their functionality:

#### 1. Arithmetic Operators: 
These operators perform arithmetic operations on numeric operands.

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b); // Addition: 15
console.log(a - b); // Subtraction: 5
console.log(a * b); // Multiplication: 50
console.log(a / b); // Division: 2
console.log(a % b); // Modulus: 0
console.log(++a);   // Increment: 11
console.log(--b);   // Decrement: 4
```
#### 2. Assignment Operators: 
These operators assign values to variables.

- Assignment (=)
- Addition assignment (+=)
- Subtraction assignment (-=)
- Multiplication assignment (*=)
- Division assignment (/=)
- Modulus assignment (%=)

```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5; // Same as x = x + 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15

let y = 20;
y -= 5; // Same as y = y - 5
console.log(y); // Output: 15

// Similarly, *=, /=, and %= can be used.
```

#### 3. Comparison Operators: 
These operators compare two values and return a Boolean result.

- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Strict equal to (===)
- Strict not equal to (!==)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = '10';

console.log(num1 == num2); // Output: true
console.log(num1 === num2); // Output: false
console.log(num1 != num2); // Output: false
console.log(num1 !== num2); // Output: true
console.log(num1 > num2); // Output: false
console.log(num1 < num2); // Output: false
console.log(num1 >= num2); // Output: true
console.log(num1 <= num2); // Output: true
```

#### 4. Logical Operators: 
These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

- Logical AND (&&)
- Logical OR (||)
- Logical NOT (!)

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

console.log(x > 5 && y < 25); // Output: true
console.log(x > 5 || y > 25); // Output: true
console.log(!(x > 5)); // Output: false
```

#### 5. Bitwise Operators: 
These operators perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.

- Bitwise AND (&)
- Bitwise OR (|)
- Bitwise XOR (^)
- Bitwise NOT (~)
- Left shift (<<)
- Right shift (>>)
- Zero-fill right shift (>>>)

```javascript
let a = 5; // 101
let b = 3; // 011

console.log(a & b); // Bitwise AND: 1
console.log(a | b); // Bitwise OR: 7
console.log(a ^ b); // Bitwise XOR: 6
console.log(~a); // Bitwise NOT: -6
console.log(a << 1); // Left shift: 10
console.log(a >> 1); // Right shift: 2
console.log(a >>> 1); // Zero-fill right shift: 2
```

#### 6. Unary Operators: 
These operators act on a single operand.

- Unary plus (+)
- Unary minus (-)
- Logical NOT (!)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)
- Typeof (typeof)
- Void (void)
- Delete (delete)

```javascript
let x = 10;
console.log(+x); // Unary plus: 10
console.log(-x); // Unary minus: -10
console.log(!true); // Logical NOT: false
console.log(++x); // Increment: 11
console.log(--x); // Decrement: 9
console.log(typeof x); // Typeof: number
console.log(void 0); // Void: undefined
delete x; // Delete
```

#### 7. Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator): 
It's the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands and is used as a shortcut for an `if...else` statement.

- Conditional (condition ? expr1 : expr2)

```javascript
let age = 20;
let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(result); // Output: Adult
```

Understanding and mastering these operators is crucial for writing efficient and concise JavaScript code.
</details>

###### 13. What is the difference between 'undefined' and 'null' in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, `undefined` and `null` are both used to represent absence of value, but they have different meanings and use cases:

#### 1. undefined:

- undefined is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables that have not been initialized or to formal parameters for which no arguments have been provided.
- It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
- When we access a variable that has been declared but not initialized, it returns undefined.
- It is also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything.

Example:

```javascript
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function foo() {}
console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined
```

#### 2. null:

- null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable does not point to any object or that a property or variable is meant to be empty.
- It is usually assigned to a variable as a programmer-defined value to indicate that it has no value.

Example:

```javascript
let y = null;
console.log(y); // Output: null
```

In summary, `undefined` typically indicates that something has not been defined or provided, whereas `null` is used to explicitly denote absence of value or to clear the value of a variable.
</details>

###### 14. How do you handle asynchronous code in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, we handle asynchronous code using various techniques, including `callbacks`, `promises`, and `async/await`. Here's a brief overview of each approach:

#### 1. Callbacks:

- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are invoked once the asynchronous operation completes.
- They are commonly used in older JavaScript code to handle asynchronous operations.

Example:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
    // Asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from a server
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = 'Some data';
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

function processResponse(data) {
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData('https://api.example.com/data', processResponse);
```

#### 2.Promises:

- Promises represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.
- They provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks, especially for chaining multiple asynchronous operations.

Example:

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = 'Some data';
            resolve(data);
        }, 1000);
    });
}

fetchData('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

#### 3. Async/Await:

- Async/await is a modern approach to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript, introduced in ES2017.
- It allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and understand, especially for developers coming from synchronous programming backgrounds.

Example:

```javascript
async function fetchData(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = 'Some data';
            resolve(data);
        }, 1000);
    });
}

async function processData() {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

processData();
```
Each of these techniques has its own use cases and benefits, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your project and personal preference.

###### 15. What is this keyword in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the current execution context, typically the object that owns or invokes the currently executing code. The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called and where it is called.

Here's a breakdown of how `this` behaves in different contexts:

#### 1. Global Context:

- In the global context (default), `this` refers to the global object, which is `window` in a web browser environment and `global` in Node.js.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(this === window); // Output: true (in a web browser)
console.log(this === global); // Output: false (in Node.js)
```
- In the global context (strict mode), `this` is `undefined`, preventing default binding.

Example:

```javascript
"use strict";
console.log(this); // undefined
```

#### 2. Function Context:

- In a function context (default), `this` depends on how the function is called. If called globally, `this` refers to the global object. If called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object itself.

Example:

```javascript
function greet() {
  return this;
}

const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  sayName: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

console.log(greet() === window); // true
console.log(greet() === global); // false
console.log(obj.sayName()); // "John"
```
- In a function context(strict mode), if a function is called without any specific object context, the value of `this` inside that function will be `undefined`. However, if the function is called as a method of an object, the value of `this` will be determined by the object calling the function and won't be affected by strict mode

Example:

```javascript
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  console.log(this); // undefined
}


"use strict";
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  sayName: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

console.log(obj.sayName()); // John

```

#### 3. Arrow Function Context:

Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical scope.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: () => {
    return this.name; // `this` refers to the outer lexical scope, not `obj`
  }
};

console.log(obj.greet()); // Output: undefined (since `this.name` is undefined)
```

#### 4. Event Handlers:

In event handlers, such as those attached with `addEventListener`, `this` refers to the element that triggered the event

Example:

```javascript
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
<script>
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // refers to the button element that triggered the event
});
</script>
```

#### 5. Constructor Functions:

In constructor functions invoked with `new`, `this` refers to the newly created object.

Example:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const john = new Person('John');
console.log(john.name); // Output: "John"
```

#### 6. Explicit Function Binding:

The `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods allow developers to explicitly set the value of this within a function call.

Example:

```javascript
const obj1 = { 
  name: 'Alice', 
  greet: function() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}!`;
  }
};

const obj2 = { name: 'Bob' };

const callResult = obj1.greet.call(obj2)
const applyResult = obj1.greet.apply(obj2)
const bindResult = obj1.greet.bind(obj2)

console.log(callResult); // "Hello, Bob!"
console.log(applyResult); // "Hello, Bob!"
console.log(bindResult()); // "Hello, Bob!"
```
</details>

###### 16. What is difference between call, bind and apply methods in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, `call`, `bind`, and `apply` are methods used to manipulate the context (`this` keyword) of a function when it's invoked. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

#### 1. call():

- The `call` method is used to invoke a function with a specified this value and arguments provided individually.
- Syntax: `function.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`

Example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: 'Alice' };

greet.call(person); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

#### 2. apply():

- The `apply` method is similar to call, but it accepts arguments as an array.
- Syntax: `function.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`

Example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: 'Bob' };

greet.apply(person); // Outputs: Hello, Bob!
```

#### 3. bind():

- The `bind` method returns a new function with a specified this value and initial arguments. It doesn't invoke the function immediately but allows we to call it later.
- Syntax: `function.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`

Example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: 'Charlie' };
const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);

greetPerson(); // Outputs: Hello, Charlie!
```

In summary, `call` and `apply` immediately invoke the function with a specified context and arguments, while `bind` returns a new function with the specified context and arguments preset, allowing for later invocation.
</details>

###### 17. How do you create a class in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To create a class in JavaScript, we use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Inside the class, we define properties and methods to describe the object's characteristics and behavior. Once the class is defined, we can create instances of it using the `new` keyword followed by the class name. These instances inherit the properties and methods defined in the class, allowing us to create multiple objects with similar functionalities.

Example:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the Person class
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Bob', 25);

// Accessing properties and methods of the instances
console.log(person1.name); // Outputs: Alice
console.log(person2.age); // Outputs: 25
person1.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.
```

- We define a `Person` class using the `class` keyword.
- The` constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing instances of the class with the `new` keyword. It sets the initial properties of the object.
- Additional methods can be defined within the class body, such as `greet`.
- We create instances of the `Person` class using the `new` keyword, passing arguments to the constructor.
- We can access properties and methods of the instances using dot notation.

Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance model that JavaScript traditionally used. Under the hood, JavaScript classes still utilize prototypes.

###### 18. What are the differences between ES5 and ES6?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
ES5 and ES6 refer to different versions of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript follows. Here are some key differences between ES5 and ES6:

#### 1. Syntax: 
ES6 introduced several new syntax features, such as `arrow functions`, `template literals`, `let` and `const` for variable declarations, `enhanced object literals`, `destructuring assignments`, and `classes`.

#### 2. Arrow Functions: 
ES6 introduced `arrow functions`, which provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions, especially for functions with implicit returns.

#### 3. Block-Scoped Declarations: 
In ES5, variables are function-scoped using `var`, while ES6 introduced `let` and `const`, which are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined.

#### 4. Classes: 
ES6 introduced a more convenient syntax for defining classes and working with inheritance in JavaScript, making object-oriented programming in JavaScript more familiar to developers from other programming languages.

#### 5. Promises: 
While promises were introduced in ES5 with libraries like Q and Bluebird, ES6 standardized promises natively in JavaScript, making asynchronous programming more manageable.

#### 6. Modules: 
ES6 introduced a native module system, allowing JavaScript code to be organized into separate files and imported/exported as needed, improving code organization and reuse.

Overall, ES6 introduced many new features and improvements over ES5, making JavaScript development more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
</details>

###### 19. What are arrow functions in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous function expressions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

Arrow functions have the following features:

#### 1. Concise Syntax: 
Arrow functions use a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions, making the code more readable and compact.

#### 2. Implicit Return: 
If the function body consists of a single expression, the curly braces and `return` keyword can be omitted, and the expression's result will be implicitly returned.

#### 3. Lexical this Binding: 
Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context; instead, they inherit the `this` value from the surrounding code when they are defined. This behavior is often desired when working with object methods or event handlers.

Here are some examples of arrow functions:

```javascript
// Traditional function expression
const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

// Arrow function equivalent
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Arrow function with implicit return
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;

// Arrow function with no parameters
const sayHello = () => console.log("Hello!");

// Arrow function as a callback
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);
```

Arrow functions are widely used in modern JavaScript codebases due to their brevity and clarity. However, it's essential to be mindful of their behavior, especially regarding `this` binding, when using them in more complex scenarios.
</details>

###### 20. What is template literal in JavaScript?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
Template literals, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), are a way to create strings in JavaScript that allow for embedded expressions and multiline strings. They are enclosed by backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes.

Template literals offer the following features:

#### 1. Embedded Expressions: 
Within template literals, we can embed expressions by using `${}` syntax. These expressions are evaluated and concatenated into the string.

#### 2. Multiline Strings: 
Template literals support multiline strings, meaning we can include line breaks directly within the string without using special characters like `\n`.

Here's an example of using template literals:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;

// Using template literal
const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(message);
```

In this example, `${name}` and `${age}` are expressions that are evaluated and inserted into the string.

Template literals provide a more concise and readable way to work with strings in JavaScript, especially when dealing with dynamic content or multiline text.

###### 21. What are rest and spread operators in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
In Javascript, both the spread operator and rest parameter have the same syntax which is three dots(…). Even though they have the same syntax they differ in functions.

#### 1. Spread operator
- The `spread operator` helps us expand an iterable such as an array where multiple arguments are needed.

Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(...numbers); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


const array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const array2 = [...array1, 60];
console.log(array2); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```
- The `spread operator` also helps us to merge, clone, or add properties to Objects.

Example:

```javascript

//1. Merging Objects
const defaults = { theme: 'light', fontSize: 14 };
const userSettings = { username: 'john_doe', ...defaults };
console.log(userSettings); 
// Output: { username: 'john_doe', theme: 'light', fontSize: 14 }


//2. Adding Properties to Objects:

const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const updatedPerson = { ...person, country: 'USA' };
console.log(updatedPerson); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, country: 'USA' }


//3. Cloning Objects:
const original = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const clone = { ...original };
console.log(clone); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

#### 2. Rest operator

The `rest parameter` is converse to the `spread operator`. while the `spread operator` expands elements of an iterable, the `rest operator` compresses them. It collects several elements.

- Object Destructuring:

Example:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, country: 'USA', gender: 'Male' };
const { name, ...details } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(details); // Output: { age: 30, country: 'USA', gender: 'Male' }
```

- Function Parameters:

```javascript
function average(...args) {
        console.log(args);
        const avg =
            args.reduce(function (a, b) {
                return a + b;
           }, 0) / args.length;
        return avg;
    }
    console.log("average of numbers is : "
        + average(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output:  "average of numbers is : 3"
    console.log("average of numbers is : " // Output:  "average of numbers is : 2"
        + average(1, 2, 3));
```
</details>

###### 22. What is destructuring in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
Destructuring in JavaScript allows us to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable manner. It enables us to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

There are two main types of destructuring in JavaScript:

#### 1. Array Destructuring:

It involves unpacking array values into variables using a syntax similar to array literals.

Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = numbers;
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

#### 2. Object Destructuring:

It involves extracting values from object properties and assigning them to variables with matching names.

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, country: 'USA' };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 30
```
Destructuring provides a more concise syntax for extracting values, especially when working with nested objects or arrays. It helps in writing cleaner and more readable code by reducing the need for repetitive syntax and assignments.

###### 23. How do you handle date and time in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, handling date and time involves using the built-in `Date` object and various methods associated with it. Here's an overview of how we can handle date and time in JavaScript:

#### 1. Creating a Date Object: 
We can create a new `Date` object to represent the current date and time or a specific date and time by passing relevant parameters such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and milliseconds.

Example:

```javascript

```

Example:

```javascript
const currentDate = new Date(); // Current date and time
const specificDate = new Date(2024, 1, 29, 12, 30, 0); // Specific date and time
```

#### 2. Getting Date and Time Components:
We can extract various components of a date and time such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and milliseconds using the `get` methods of the `Date` object.

Example:

```javascript
const year = currentDate.getFullYear();
const month = currentDate.getMonth(); // Month is zero-based (0 for January, 11 for December)
const day = currentDate.getDate();
const hours = currentDate.getHours();
const minutes = currentDate.getMinutes();
const seconds = currentDate.getSeconds();
```

#### 3. Formatting Dates: 
We can format dates and times using various methods such as `toDateString()`, `toLocaleDateString()`, `toTimeString()`, and `toLocaleTimeString()` to get human-readable date and time strings.

Example:

```javascript
const dateString = currentDate.toDateString(); // "Wed Feb 28 2024"
const timeString = currentDate.toTimeString(); // "12:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)"
```

#### 4. Parsing Dates: 
JavaScript provides methods like `Date.parse()` and new `Date()` to parse date strings into `Date` objects.

Example:

```javascript
const parsedDate = new Date('2024-02-29T12:30:00'); // Parsing ISO format string
```

#### 5. Manipulating Dates: 
We can manipulate dates by adding or subtracting milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years from a `Date` object.

Example:

```javascript
currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1); // Adding one day
```

#### 6. Comparing Dates: 
Dates can be compared using comparison operators `(<, <=, >, >=)` or methods like `getTime()` to compare milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

```javascript
const futureDate = new Date(2025, 1, 1);
if (currentDate.getTime() < futureDate.getTime()) {
    console.log('Current date is before the future date.');
}
```
By using these techniques, we can effectively handle date and time operations in JavaScript for various applications such as scheduling, event handling, and data analysis.

###### 24. How do you handle regular expressions in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Handling regular expressions in JavaScript involves using the built-in `RegExp` object and its methods. Here's an overview of how we can work with regular expressions in JavaScript:

#### 1. Creating Regular Expressions: 
Regular expressions can be created using either the regular expression literal syntax `(/pattern/flags)` or the `RegExp` constructor function.

Example:

```javascript
const regexLiteral = /pattern/flags;
const regexConstructor = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');
```

#### 2. Matching Patterns: 
We can use regular expressions to match patterns within strings using methods like `test()` and `exec()`.

Example:

```javascript
const str = 'Hello, world!';
const regex = /world/;
console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
console.log(regex.exec(str)); // Output: ['world', index: 7, input: 'Hello, world!', groups: undefined]
```

#### 3. Extracting Matches: 
Regular expressions can be used to extract matched substrings from strings using methods like `match()` and `exec()`.

Example:

```javascript
const str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';
const regex = /fox/;
console.log(str.match(regex)); // Output: ['fox']
```

#### 4. Replacing Matches: 
We can use regular expressions to replace matched substrings within strings using methods like `replace()`.
Example:

```javascript
const str = 'Hello, world!';
const regex = /world/;
console.log(str.replace(regex, 'Universe')); // Output: 'Hello, Universe!'
```

#### 5. Splitting Strings: 
Regular expressions can be used to split strings into arrays of substrings using the `split()` method.

Example:

```javascript
const str = 'apple,banana,orange';
const regex = /,/;
console.log(str.split(regex)); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

#### 6. Flags: 
Regular expressions support various flags such as `i` (ignore case), `g` (global search), `m` (multiline), and `s` (dotall).

Example:

```javascript
const str = 'Hello, World!';
const regex = /hello/i; // Ignore case
console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
```

#### 7. Character Classes and Quantifiers: 

Regular expressions support character classes like `\d` (digit), `\w` (word character), and quantifiers like `+` (one or more), `*` (zero or more), `?` (zero or one).

Example:

```javascript
const str = '123-456-7890';
const regex = /\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/;
console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
```
By using these techniques, we can effectively work with regular expressions in JavaScript for tasks such as pattern matching, validation, and text manipulation.

###### 25. What are the different ways to create functions in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, there are several ways to create functions, each with its own syntax and use cases:

#### 1. Function Declaration:

Example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    return 'Hello, world!';
}
greet() //Output: Hello, world!
```

#### 2. Function Expression:

Example:

```javascript
const greet = function() {
    return 'Hello, world!';
};
greet() //Output: Hello, world!
```

#### 3. Arrow Function (Introduced in ES6):

Example:

```javascript
const greet = () => {
    return 'Hello, world!';
};
greet() //Output: Hello, world!
```

#### 4. Function Constructor (Not recommended due to security and performance implications):

Example:

```javascript
const greet = new Function('return "Hello, world!";');
greet() //Output: Hello, world!
```

#### 5. Named Function Expression:

Example:

```javascript
const greet = function sayHello() {
    return 'Hello, world!';
};
greet() //Output: Hello, world!
```

#### 6. Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):

Example:

```javascript
(function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
})(); //Output: Hello, world!
```
#### 7. Generator Function (Introduced in ES6):

Example:

```javascript
function* generatorFunction() {
  yield 'Hello';
  yield ', ';
  yield 'world';
  yield '!';
}

const generator = generatorFunction();
let result = '';

for (const value of generator) {
  result += value;
}

console.log(result); // Output: "Hello, world!"
```
Each of these methods has its own advantages and use cases. Function declarations and expressions are commonly used for defining reusable blocks of code. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax, especially for short, one-liner functions. Function constructors and generator functions offer more advanced features but are less commonly used in everyday programming.

###### 26. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript, synchronous code executes in sequence, blocking further execution until the current operation finishes. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows the program to continue executing while waiting for an operation to complete. This is achieved through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

#### 1. Synchronous Code:
- Executes sequentially, one operation at a time.
- Blocks further execution until the current operation is complete.
- Can lead to blocking behavior, especially with long-running tasks.
- Commonly used for simple, linear tasks where the order of execution matters.

Example:

```javascript
console.log('Start');
console.log('Middle');
console.log('End');

//Output:
//Start
//Middle
//End
```

#### 2. Asynchronous Code:
- Executes non-sequentially, allowing other operations to run concurrently.
- Does not block further execution, enabling better responsiveness.
- Commonly used for I/O operations, network requests, and tasks with unpredictable timing.
- Requires handling callbacks, promises, or async/await for managing asynchronous tasks.

Example with Callbacks:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Middle');
}, 1000);

console.log('End');

//Output:
//Start
//End
//Middle
```
In this example, "Start" is logged first, then "End", and finally "Middle" after a delay of 1 second. While waiting for the delay, other operations can continue executing, demonstrating the asynchronous nature of setTimeout.

Overall, understanding the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code is crucial for building efficient and responsive JavaScript applications.

###### 27. What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
In JavaScript, there are several types of loops commonly used for iterating over arrays, objects, or executing code repeatedly. The main types of loops are:

#### 1. for loop: 
Executes a block of code a specified number of times.

Exmaple:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### 2. while loop:

Exmaple:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### 3. do...while loop:

Exmaple:

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### Note: While loop vs. do...while loop

- While loop: Executes the code block as long as the condition is true. It checks the condition before executing the block.
- Do...while loop: Similar to a while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. This ensures that the block of code is executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

Example:

```javascript
let i = 0;

// While loop
while (i < 0) {
  console.log('While loop:', i); 
  // This code won't execute because the condition is false initially
  i++;
}

// Do...while loop
do {
  console.log('Do...while loop:', i); 
  // This code will execute at least once;
  //Output:  Do...while loop:, 0
  i++;
} while (i < 0);
```

#### 4. for...in loop:

Exmaple:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);
}
// Output: name John, age 30
```

#### 5. for...of loop:

Exmaple:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3
```

#### Note: for...in loop vs. for...of loop

1. for...in loop:
- Usage: Typically used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.
- Iterates over: Enumerables properties of an object, including inherited properties from the prototype chain.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const key in obj) {
  console.log(key); // Outputs: 'a', 'b', 'c'
  console.log(obj[key]); // Outputs: 1, 2, 3
}
```
##### Note: It's not recommended to use `for...in` loop with arrays because it can also iterate over array prototype properties, and the iteration order may not be guaranteed.

2. for...of loop
- Usage: Used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, sets, maps, etc.
- Iterates over: The values of an iterable object, not including prototype properties.

Example:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (const item of arr) {
  console.log(item); // Outputs: 1, 2, 3
}
```
##### Note: 
- for...of loop cannot be used to iterate over plain objects (i.e., objects created with `{}`). It's specifically designed for iterable objects.
- In summary, while both loops are used for iteration, `for...in` is more suitable for objects and `for...of` is preferred for iterating over the values of iterable objects like arrays and strings.

Each type of loop has its use cases and advantages, so choosing the right one depends on the specific requirements of our code.

###### 28. How do you break out of a loop in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
In JavaScript, we can break out of a loop using the `break` statement. The `break` statement is typically used within loops (such as `for`, `while`, or `do...while`) to immediately terminate the loop's execution when a certain condition is met.

Here's an example of using `break` in a `for loop`:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is equal to 5
  }
  console.log(i); //Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```
In this example, the loop will iterate from `0` to `4`. When `i` becomes `5`, the break statement is executed, causing the loop to terminate immediately.

Similarly, we can use the `break` statement in a `while` or `do...while loop` to break out of the loop based on certain conditions.

Here's an example of using `break` in a `while loop`:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is equal to 5
  }
  console.log(i); //Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```

And here's an example using a `do...while loop`:

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); //Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is equal to 5
  }
} while (i < 10);
```
In all cases, when the `break` statement is encountered, the loop immediately terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

###### 29. How do you handle multiple asynchronous requets in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
To handle multiple asynchronous requests in JavaScript, we typically use techniques like Promises, async/await, or libraries like Axios or Fetch API.

With Promises, we can make multiple asynchronous calls simultaneously and wait for all of them to finish using `Promise.all()` or `Promise.race()`.

Example with `Promise.all()`:

```javascript
const promise1 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');
const promise2 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(responses => {
    // Handle responses
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

With async/await, we can make our code look synchronous while dealing with asynchronous operations.

```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const data1 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');
    const data2 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');
    // Handle data
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}

getData();
```
These methods allow us to manage multiple asynchronous requests effectively, ensuring proper handling of responses and errors.
